# School-Basketball-Team-Analysis

This is a diary-like file to document the progress we have made in some periods.


2018.6.10 ---2018.7.5

  To do the analysis of our school basketball team project, initially I want to get the access of the website API to directly fetch some data we want to work with, but after some emails with the website staffs, I cannot directly get the access from their site.
  I also tried scrapy and beautiful soup to scrape data from the website , but since the website have a lot of restrictions and log in session, I couldn't do that either.
  Since then till now, I have been working on copying the data from the website into the txt file and design our own database.
  Since the data I got in txt file are unstructured file, I found between lines of the text there are some pattern i can take advantage of to create some regexes in Python and found a way to reorganize them into nicely structured csv files so that I can directly import those files into my designed database. For those files please refer to the .py files i uploaded.

2018.7.6 - 7.10

  During this period we developed the whole database structure for future analysis, please refer to the ERD diagram and the table structure for more information.
